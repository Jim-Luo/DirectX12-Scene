The aim of this project is to implement a particle system with DirectX 12 API, and as youcan see, the implementation of the campfire uses particle system.

## TODO

- The effect is not satisfying and models are coarse, I may change them in the future.
- The architecture of the project is not reasonable, I will rebuild it if possible.
